   abstract = {Ad hoc networks have been proved to be suitable for disaster scenarios since any infrastructure need to be deployed in order to establish a wireless network. Routing protocols play an important role in the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. Routing protocols are responsible for deciding how the information is going to move through the network. Although one paramount parameter of ad hoc networks is the mobility of nodes, little effort has been made to evaluate the performance of mobile ad hoc networks under mobility models which model the movements of rescue teams during evacuating operations. The objective of this paper is to evaluate real case disaster scenarios in terms of performance using several well-known routing protocols metrics. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Mobile AdHoc NETworks (MANETs) have been identified as a key emerging technology for scenarios in which IEEE 802.11 or cellular communications are either infeasible, inefficient, or cost-ineffective. Smartphones are the most adequate network nodes in many of these scenarios, but it is not straightforward to build a network with them. We extensively survey existing possibilities to build applications on top of ad-hoc smartphone networks for experimentation purposes, and introduce a taxonomy to classify them. We present AdHocDroid, an Android package that creates an IP-level MANET of (rooted) Android smartphones. AdHocDroid supports standard TCP/IP applications, providing real smartphone IEEE 802.11 MANET and the capability to easily change the routing protocol. We validate the MANET with off-the-shelf applications and experimental performance evaluation, including network metrics and battery discharge rate.},

The network is built of inexpensive, small-footprint, energy-frugal, possibly mobile nodes running reactive programs and self-organizing themselves into resilient distributed systems in a manner embracing the limited capabilities of the devices as well as the unreliable nature of ad-hoc wireless communication. We propose and elaborate on a holistic approach to constructing complete WSN applications. Our approach incorporates a certain unified programming and communication paradigm. In addition to producing small, energy-efficient, self-documenting and reliable programs for ultra-small-footprint motes, that paradigm enables authoritative virtual execution of complete application, thus facilitating their rapid development, testing, augmentation and modification.},

now-a-days, people have become more concerned about their
social connections even when communication infrastructure such
as cellular and Wi-Fi networks are not available. Previous
attempts towards solving this issue have focused on specific usecases such as disaster recovery applications or chat applications.
We have identified the need for a framework which enables
infrastructure-less communication and which can be reused in
different use-cases. Therefore, we have designed and implemented
the Meshify framework which enables smooth interaction among
devices when there is no communication infrastructure available.
Meshify takes into consideration efficient neighbor discovery
as well as multi-hop routing and provides features such as
private messages and broadcast messages. Finally, a prototype
application MeshifyChat is developed based on Meshify framework, which enables real-time chats among people in proximity
to support their social interactions independent of the existing
communication infrastructure.},

@article{todtenberg2019,
   abstract = {Bluetooth was firstly announced in 1998. Originally designed as cable replacement connecting devices in a point-to-point fashion its high penetration arouses interest in its ad-hoc networking potential. This ad-hoc networking potential of Bluetooth is advertised for years - but until recently no actual products were available and less than a handful of real Bluetooth multi-hop network deployments were reported. The turnaround was triggered by the release of the Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Profile which is unquestionable a great achievement but not well suited for all use cases of multi-hop networks. This paper surveys the tremendous work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks during the last 20 years. All aspects are discussed with demands for a real world Bluetooth multi-hop operation in mind. Relationships and side effects of different topics for a real world implementation are explained. This unique focus distinguishes this survey from existing ones. Furthermore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first survey consolidating the work on Bluetooth multi-hop networks for classic Bluetooth technology as well as for Bluetooth Low Energy. Another individual characteristic of this survey is a synopsis of real world Bluetooth multi-hop network deployment efforts. In fact, there are only four reports of a successful establishment of a Bluetooth multi-hop network with more than 30 nodes and only one of them was integrated in a real world application - namely a photovoltaic power plant.},

   abstract = {With the increasing availability of mobile devices that natively support Device-to-Device (D2D) communication protocols, we are presented with a unique opportunity to realize large scale ad hoc wireless networks. Recently, a novel D2D protocol named WiFi Direct has been proposed and standardized by the WiFi Alliance with the objective of facilitating the interconnection of nearby devices. However, WiFi Direct has been designed following a client-server hierarchical architecture, where a single device manages all the communications within a group of devices. In this paper, we propose and analyze different solutions for supporting the communications between multiple WiFi Direct groups using Android OS devices. By describing the WiFi Direct standard and the limitations of the current implementation of the Android WiFi Direct framework, we present possible solutions to interconnect different groups to create multi-hop ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that our proposed approaches are feasible with different overhead in terms of energy consumption and delay at the gateway node. Additionally, our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of techniques that exploit the device ability to maintain simultaneous physical connections to multiple groups.},

This research presents the results of a detailed performance evaluation on several MANET routing protocols working under realistic environments. The routing protocols, mobility models and other aspects are explained and discussed in order to know how to use them properly to model real-life conditions. NS-2 and Bonnmotion were used to create the networks, services and environment characteristics in general. It is concluded which protocols can handle which applications and which not and that the performance of the protocols can be considerably di erent when more and more realistic elements are taken into account. This should be considered in further researches since the nowadays evolution of MANET will bring them soon into services of our society.},
