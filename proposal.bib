   abstract = {We introduce a wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture intended for massive deployments in custom applications where the primary goal is the collection of low-volume (e.g., telemetric) data possibly augmented with spontaneous special events, like alerts or alarms. The network is built of inexpensive, small-footprint, energy-frugal, possibly mobile nodes running reactive programs and self-organizing themselves into resilient distributed systems in a manner embracing the limited capabilities of the devices as well as the unreliable nature of ad-hoc wireless communication. We propose and elaborate on a holistic approach to constructing complete WSN applications. Our approach incorporates a certain unified programming and communication paradigm. In addition to producing small, energy-efficient, self-documenting and reliable programs for ultra-small-footprint motes, that paradigm enables authoritative virtual execution of complete application, thus facilitating their rapid development, testing, augmentation and modification.},

   abstract = {With the technological advancements we experience
now-a-days, people have become more concerned about their
social connections even when communication infrastructure such
as cellular and Wi-Fi networks are not available. Previous
attempts towards solving this issue have focused on specific usecases such as disaster recovery applications or chat applications.
We have identified the need for a framework which enables
infrastructure-less communication and which can be reused in
different use-cases. Therefore, we have designed and implemented
the Meshify framework which enables smooth interaction among
devices when there is no communication infrastructure available.
Meshify takes into consideration efficient neighbor discovery
as well as multi-hop routing and provides features such as
private messages and broadcast messages. Finally, a prototype
application MeshifyChat is developed based on Meshify framework, which enables real-time chats among people in proximity
to support their social interactions independent of the existing
communication infrastructure.},

@article{todtenberg2019,
   abstract = {Bluetooth was firstly announced in 1998. Originally designed as cable replacement connecting devices in a point-to-point fashion its high penetration arouses interest in its ad-hoc networking potential. This ad-hoc networking potential of Bluetooth is advertised for years - but until recently no actual products were available and less than a handful of real Bluetooth multi-hop network deployments were reported. The turnaround was triggered by the release of the Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Profile which is unquestionable a great achievement but not well suited for all use cases of multi-hop networks. This paper surveys the tremendous work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks during the last 20 years. All aspects are discussed with demands for a real world Bluetooth multi-hop operation in mind. Relationships and side effects of different topics for a real world implementation are explained. This unique focus distinguishes this survey from existing ones. Furthermore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first survey consolidating the work on Bluetooth multi-hop networks for classic Bluetooth technology as well as for Bluetooth Low Energy. Another individual characteristic of this survey is a synopsis of real world Bluetooth multi-hop network deployment efforts. In fact, there are only four reports of a successful establishment of a Bluetooth multi-hop network with more than 30 nodes and only one of them was integrated in a real world application - namely a photovoltaic power plant.},

   abstract = {With the increasing availability of mobile devices that natively support Device-to-Device (D2D) communication protocols, we are presented with a unique opportunity to realize large scale ad hoc wireless networks. Recently, a novel D2D protocol named WiFi Direct has been proposed and standardized by the WiFi Alliance with the objective of facilitating the interconnection of nearby devices. However, WiFi Direct has been designed following a client-server hierarchical architecture, where a single device manages all the communications within a group of devices. In this paper, we propose and analyze different solutions for supporting the communications between multiple WiFi Direct groups using Android OS devices. By describing the WiFi Direct standard and the limitations of the current implementation of the Android WiFi Direct framework, we present possible solutions to interconnect different groups to create multi-hop ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that our proposed approaches are feasible with different overhead in terms of energy consumption and delay at the gateway node. Additionally, our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of techniques that exploit the device ability to maintain simultaneous physical connections to multiple groups.},
