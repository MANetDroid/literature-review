\section{Research Objectives}

This project aims to improve the infrastructure-less communication framework
and chat application implementation with added functionality for file
transferring. Following are the sub-objectives we have identified:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Middleware Framework development: develop an improved middleware
          framework for enabling communication in infrastructure-less
          environments
          utilizing sound software engineering practices and patterns to create
          a
          middleware that third-party application developers can efficiently
          use.
    \item Communication Medium Enhancement: incorporate WiFi-Direct WiFi Direct
          as a transport mechanism and enhance the existing Bluetooth/BLE functionality.
    \item Neighbour Discovery and Message Relaying: To improve neighbor
          discovery protocols and explore multi-hop message relaying techniques.
\end{itemize}
