\section{Research Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Develop a modular application layer framework to enable ad hoc
            networking in
            Android smartphones with Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, and WiFi Direct
            as
            communication methods.
      \item Develop a prototype chat application with filesharing capabilities
            implementing
            the developed framework.
      \item Simulate reactive routing protocols with mobility models and
            identify suitable
            protocols for a typical mobility model.
\end{itemize}
